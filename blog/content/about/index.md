ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹, Wrold.

I am an immigrant originally from [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh); my family moved to the US in the mid 90s when I was 5 years old.
As a Queens native, I have had the good fortune to attend and graduate from two top tier academic institutions in NYC: [Stuyvesant High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School) and [the Cooper Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union).

Currently I am a Senior Engineering Manager at Peloton; I have the privilege of leading four teams: the Product API Internal team, the Workout Journey team, the Leaderboard team and the Metrics and Messaging team. We own and operate microservices that help power the leaderboard, real-time in class notifications and a GraphQL gateway for client <> API communications. In sum, we are responsible for operating services that account for a substantial portion of _all_ traffic coming in to the Peloton API.

In the recent past, I also moonlighted as an [adjunct professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2637751) at [Baruch University](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/faculty-research/academic-departments/information-technology-statistics/) and as an [instructor](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/taqqui-karim/1667) at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/). (I have since scaled back my activities to focus on building the best possible team experience I can at PTON).

I've posted on and off on platforms such as [Medium](https://taqkarim.medium.com/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/taqkarim) in the past - this blog is an exercise in asserting better ownership of my content (mainly for the purpose of retaining long term access). 

I will typically write about topics I find interesting and/or esoteric bugs I've discovered while building something. I strongly value feedback and would very much appreciate any constructive criticism you might have about my content. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or Linkedin (links available on main menu).

Thanks for stopping by, fam.
