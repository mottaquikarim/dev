I am an immigrant originally from [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh); my family moved to the US in the mid 90s when I was 5 years old.
As a Queens native, I have had the fortune to attend and graduate from two top tier academic institutions in NYC: [Stuyvesant High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School) and [the Cooper Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union).

Currently I am a backend software engineer at Oracle. I also moonlight as an [adjunct professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2637751) at [Baruch University](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/faculty-research/academic-departments/information-technology-statistics/) and as an [instructor](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/taqqui-karim/1667) at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).

I've posted on and off on platforms such as [Medium](https://taqkarim.medium.com/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/taqkarim) in the past - this blog is an exercise in asserting better ownership of my content (mainly for the purpose of retaining long term access). 

I will typically write about topics I find interesting and/or esoteric bugs I've discovered while building something. Thanks for stopping by, fam.
