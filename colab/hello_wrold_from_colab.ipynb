        "\n",
        "In fact, any `ipynb` file is fair game - just drop it in to a particular folder and on build, it will be converted to a markdown file, \"sanitized\" and then available as a normal post on Hugo.\n",

        "## Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "No reason! \"Just because\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Admittedly, it probably isn't a great idea to load data from two sources (as raw markdown and also available randomly as python notebooks).\n",
        "\n",
        "Really, this is mainly a thought experiment. I've dabbled in static site generation from python notebooks before and will probably do so again.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the plus side, composing python related posts got a heck of a lot easier since Python Notebooks can/will provide the ability to add code cells and output \"for free\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it _is_ kinda nice to have a web interface for composing stuff without having to go to terminal. Still, this particular approach is certifiably insane and there are definitely...easier options. Still! This is a fun thought experiment/demo! \n",

        "- Use colab's \"save to github\" feature to push to the correct repo and sub folder\n",
        "- Set up github workflow to process .ipynb files\n",
        "- on save to github, workflow triggers script that used `jupytext` to convert into markdown and moves to huge content folder\n",
