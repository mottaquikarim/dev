        "In particular, this struck me as interesting:\n",
        "\n",
        "> If you truly want to isolate the function call to the setInterval, you can use this trick of self-executing function that returns itself:\n",
        "\n",
        "```js\n",
        "// Use a named function ...\n",
        "setInterval(function myFunction() {\n",
        "  // Do some stuff\n",
        "  // ...\n",
        "\n",
        "  // ... then return this function\n",
        "  return myFunction;\n",
        "\n",
        "// () self-executes the function\n",
        "}(), 3000)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> The down side to this pattern is that it causes a maintenance issue, where the next developer doesn't understand what is going on.\n",
        "> Maintenance is an important part of being a good engineer, so at the very least, documentation in the form of comments or a helper function should be required. If you really want to have a self-executing setInterval, you've got it!\n",

        "// in js, the last item in a comma separated list is \"returned\"\n",
        "let p = (console.log('hello!'), 5)\n",
        "console.log(p)\n",

        "    console.log(\"Hello, Wrold!\"),\n",
        "    // more logic? ok let's have a func instead\n",

        "        console.log('I will run immediately!', new Date())\n",
        "    }(),\n",
        "    // this is the last func, so it will be set as THE callback\n",

        "        console.log('hello!', new Date())\n",
        "    }\n",
        "), 1000)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "With this approach, we end up with the following output:\n",
        "\n",
        "```text\n",
        "> hello!\n",
        "> 5\n",
        "> Hello, Wrold!\n",
        "> I will run immediately! Mon Jan 17 2022 22:21:44 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n",
        "> hello! Mon Jan 17 2022 22:21:46 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The long and short of it is that javascript's `,` ([comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator)) will evaluate each operand and return the final one.\n",
        "\n",
        "We exploit this property in `setInterval` which allows us to run and evaluate whatever commands we'd like before we \"return\" the actual `setInterval` callback. \n",
        "\n",
        "The major downside to this approach is that we cannot share a variable within this scope. But, on the upside the readability improves and the option to name functions meaninfully at least improves clarity.\n",
