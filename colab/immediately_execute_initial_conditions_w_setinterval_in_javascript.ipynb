        "In particular, this struck me as interesting:\n",
        "\n",
        "> If you truly want to isolate the function call to the setInterval, you can use this trick of self-executing function that returns itself:\n",
        "\n",
        "```js\n",
        "// Use a named function ...\n",
        "setInterval(function myFunction() {\n",
        "  // Do some stuff\n",
        "  // ...\n",
        "\n",
        "  // ... then return this function\n",
        "  return myFunction;\n",
        "\n",
        "// () self-executes the function\n",
        "}(), 3000)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> The down side to this pattern is that it causes a maintenance issue, where the next developer doesn't understand what is going on.\n",
        "> Maintenance is an important part of being a good engineer, so at the very least, documentation in the form of comments or a helper function should be required. If you really want to have a self-executing setInterval, you've got it!\n",

        "// in js, the last item in a comma separated list is \"returned\"\n",
        "let p = (console.log('hello!'), 5)\n",
        "console.log(p)\n",

        "        console.log('I will run immediately!', new Date())\n",
        "    }(),\n",
        "    // this is the last func, so it will be set as THE callback\n",
